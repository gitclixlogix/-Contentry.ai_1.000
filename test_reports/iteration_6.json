The page contains 14 DocScreenshot placeholders that show 'Screenshot not yet captured' with 'Capture Screenshot' buttons - these are expected as screenshots need to be captured separately. The frontend needed a rebuild (yarn build) and restart to pick up the changes from the source file. All sections are navigable via the 'On This Page' sidebar. NotificationCard components display example notifications for both Creator (approved/rejected) and Manager (new submissions, queue summary) roles."
